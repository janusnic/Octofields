# Octofields

Custom Page & Static Pages fields for OctoberCMS

## Motivation

Coming from MODX, the only thing I feel that is missing is these custom input fields for templates. In MODX, they were referred to as `template variables` and they were lovely.

## Goals
* 100% File-based.
* Attached onto templates -> used where template is used.
* All current input widgets plus images and 'repeaters/migx/gridlists'

## Nothing to see here... yet.
